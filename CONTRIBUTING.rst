Setting Up the Code for Local Development
-----------------------------------------

Here's how to set up cinephile for local development.

1. Fork the cinephile repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/cinephile.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv cinephile
    $ cd cinephile/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
